CAMPUSPE PYTHON BASICS ASSIGNMENT - SUBMISSION
===========================================================
NAME: AKASH DG
TOTAL QUESTIONS ATTEMPTED: 20/20 
PASSING MARK: 60/100 [cite: 5]

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- The script 'main.py' contains a central menu to navigate 
  through all 20 questions for easier evaluation[cite: 206].
- I have used 'f-strings' for formatting to ensure the outputs 
  are visually appealing as requested in Q1[cite: 39].
- Input validation (try-except) is implemented globally to 
  handle edge cases and invalid inputs[cite: 12, 207].

CHALLENGES FACED:
1. Q11 (Pattern 4): Aligning the numbers to form a perfect 
   symmetrical pyramid required careful spacing logic[cite: 169].
2. Q16 (Number Guessing Game): Implementing the hint system 
   to detect if a user was "within 5" of the target[cite: 190].
3. Q19/Q20 (Hard Level): Managing word frequency dictionaries 
   and calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM) through 
   the GCD formula[cite: 200, 204].

RESOURCES USED:
- Official Python Documentation (Syntax Reference).
- Course Modules 1-6.
